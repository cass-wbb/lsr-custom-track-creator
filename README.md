This will (hopefully) become a functional track editor for LEGO Stunt Rally, which is a game I love dearly. 

When this is completed, it should produce a fully functional .trk file, able to be imported into the Stunt Rally folder, or on a floppy disk to play in the game itself.

As this is very much a work in progress, it likely won't do any of that for quite a while.
